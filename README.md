# Tab Utilities Fixed (Deprecated)

[Tab Utilities](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tab-utilities/)'s compatibility fixes release.

The project's focused goal: Compatibility fixes for Firefox 28 (with orange 'Firefox' button or Pale Moon) to the latest Firefox Beta (tested for Windows).

Issue reports and patches are welcome.

## Deprecated
This project has been deprecated due to the new browser extension standard ([WebExtensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions); [W3C](https://browserext.github.io/browserext/); [Terminology](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Add-ons/Terminology)) to Firefox 57 and difficult to maintain, it still has some bugs in the final version, such as full screen support, as well as other quirks.

If you would, you can continue to report problems (but no guaranteed for repair) or recommend alternatives on the issues.
